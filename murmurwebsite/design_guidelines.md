# Public Safety Monitoring Platform Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**System-Based Approach** using a government/enterprise design system inspired by Carbon Design System and USWDS (U.S. Web Design System). This utility-focused application prioritizes clarity, accessibility, and professional credibility for law enforcement users.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Light Mode:**
- Primary: 220 85% 25% (Deep government blue)
- Secondary: 0 0% 45% (Professional gray)
- Accent: 10 90% 50% (Alert red for critical incidents)
- Background: 0 0% 98% (Near white)
- Surface: 0 0% 100% (Pure white)

**Dark Mode:**
- Primary: 220 60% 70% (Lighter blue for contrast)
- Secondary: 0 0% 70% (Light gray)
- Accent: 10 80% 60% (Softer alert red)
- Background: 220 13% 18% (Dark blue-gray)
- Surface: 220 10% 25% (Elevated surface)

### B. Typography
- **Primary Font:** Inter (Google Fonts) - Clean, highly readable
- **Headings:** 600-700 weight, sizes from text-lg to text-3xl
- **Body:** 400-500 weight, text-sm to text-base
- **Data/Numbers:** 500-600 weight for emphasis on statistics

### C. Layout System
**Tailwind Spacing:** Primary units of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16
- Tight spacing (2, 4) for form elements and data tables
- Medium spacing (6, 8) for component separation
- Wide spacing (12, 16) for major layout sections

### D. Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Top navigation bar with government-style branding
- Role-based menu items (Public vs Authority access)
- Breadcrumb navigation for location drilling

**Heat Map Interface:**
- Full-screen map with overlay controls
- Floating search panel (top-left) with zip/city/area input
- Legend panel (bottom-right) showing incident severity levels
- Incident markers with color coding (green/yellow/orange/red)

**Authority Dashboard:**
- Split layout: Map (70%) + Details panel (30%)
- Audio player component with waveform visualization
- Incident timeline with timestamps
- Filter controls for date range, incident type, severity

**Data Tables:**
- Zebra striping for row clarity
- Sortable column headers
- Pagination with row count display
- Export functionality buttons

**Authentication:**
- Clean, centered login forms
- Government-style branding
- Role selection (Authority/Public) prominently displayed

### E. Visual Hierarchy
- Use card-based layouts with subtle shadows (shadow-sm to shadow-md)
- Clear section dividers with background color variations
- Bold headings with ample whitespace
- Progressive disclosure for detailed incident information

## Key Features & Layout

**Public Interface:**
- Simplified header with app branding
- Full-screen heat map as primary content
- Search functionality prominently placed
- Minimal UI chrome to focus on data visualization

**Authority Interface:**
- Enhanced header with user profile and logout
- Tabbed interface: "Live Map", "Analytics", "Reports"
- Audio playback controls integrated with incident details
- Advanced filtering and export capabilities

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-first approach with collapsible panels
- Touch-friendly controls for map navigation
- Stacked layout on smaller screens

## Accessibility & Performance
- High contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliant)
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader friendly map annotations
- Lazy loading for incident audio files
- Progressive enhancement for map features

This design emphasizes trust, professionalism, and efficiencyâ€”critical for government and public safety applications while maintaining clear visual hierarchy for both public transparency and authority functionality.
